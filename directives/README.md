This directory contains the "SOPs" (Standard Operating Procedures) for the agent system. These are markdown files that describe the high-level goals and instructions for the agent to follow.

## How to use
Create a new markdown file in this directory with a descriptive name (e.g., `scrape_website.md`). Write clear, step-by-step instructions in natural language.
